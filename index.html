<h1>Smidge</h1>

<p>Black + White Photography is a passion of Photo Artist Smidge.</p>

<h2>Photo Art</h2>

<p>Smidge has to photograph almost everything he sees. And this is how he developed his passion for Photo Art and of telling his story of everyday sights in black and white digital imaging.</p>

<p>A piece of fruit, a map, grafitti, or street furniture can be combined to tell a special story under Smidge's expert photography.</p>
